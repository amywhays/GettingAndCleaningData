Discription of Project

To create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


The website the raw data is from:

Here is the raw data zip file (Which needs to be unzipped for this script to work.  Unzipped to the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory in your R-Studio working directory.  *You do not need to change your working directory.*):
